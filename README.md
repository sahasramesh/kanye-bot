# kanye-bot

Kanye bot is a Twitter bot that takes words from Kanye's discography and uses them to generate 
brand new coherent sentences. The program uses a text document containing all of Kanye's lyrics
and uses a Markov chain to create sentences that reflect the frequency and order of words that
that Kanye uses.
